# Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub

Used pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub, perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on real-world data,
 build and evaluate multiple models for text classification with TensorFlow,
 and visualize model performance metrics with Tensorboard.
